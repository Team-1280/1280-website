Its mission is to inspire and educate young people in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through a mentor-based teaching system.</div>

                        <div className="px-10 text-gray-500">FIRST® runs several programs for different age groups, including the Junior LEGO® League, FIRST® LEGO® League (FLL), FIRST® Tech Challenge (FTC), and the flagship FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC), which Ragin’ C Biscuits competes in. Each year, FIRST® releases a new game for each program, challenging teams to strategize, design, prototype, build, program, and test their robot within a six-week build season. Afterward, teams compete in regional events for a chance to qualify for the annual World Championship in Houston, Texas.</div>

                        <div className="px-10 text-gray-500">In the world of FIRST®, two core values stand out: Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition®. Gracious Professionalism, a term coined by FIRST® advisor Woodie Flowers, encourages teams to compete honorably while respecting one another. Coopertition builds on this idea, promoting collaboration and mutual learning even during competition.</div>
